#  Obtaining api_id
To obtain an API ID using the Telegram API you need to do the following:

1. Log in to your Telegram core: https://my.telegram.org/apps.
2. Now you are in "API development tools" so fill out the form(with random details).
3. You will get basic addresses and the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization.

# Using the api_id

Before using the MTProto Telegram API, please note that all API client libraries are strictly monitored to prevent abuse.

If you use the Telegram API for flooding, spamming, faking subscribers and view counters of channels, you will be banned forever.

*Due to excessive abuse of the Telegram API, all accounts that sign up or log in using unofficial Telegram API clients are automatically put under observation to avoid violations of the Terms of Service.*

If you didn't violate the Terms of Service but your account does get banned after using the API, write to recover@telegram.org explaining what you intend to do with the API, asking to unban your account.
Please note that emails are checked by a human, so automatically generated emails will be detected and banned.
